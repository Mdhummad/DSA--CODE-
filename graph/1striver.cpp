/*
UNDIRECTED GRAPH
in an undirected graph edge is always bidirectional between the two nodes

DIRECTED EDGE
there are directed edge present in directed graph
there can be multiple edge between two nodes(bidirectional)

CYCLES IN A GRAPH
start from a node and end at that node
a graph doesnot necessarly mean it is a inclosed structure(not necessarly have cycle)


UNDiRECTED CYCLIC GRAPH == graph containing a single cycle
DIRECTED ACYCLIC GRAPH == graph that is directed but do not have cycle

PATH == contain a lot of  nodes and each of them is reachable(A NODE CANNOT APPEAR TWICE IN A PATH)

DEGREES IN A GRAPH == no. of edges attached to a nodes

=======================================================
IMP                                                   =
TOTAL DEGREE OF A GRAPH =   2 * NO. OF EDGES IN A GRAPH  =
=======================================================

INDEGREE=no. of incoming edges
OUTDEGREE=no. of outgoing edges


EDGE WEIGHT= usually assigned if not assihned we take it as 1
